(** Adaptive sampling of 2D curves.

   @version %%VERSION%% *)

type _ t
(** Representation of a 2D sampling.  This can be thought as a path,
   with possible "jumps" because of discontinuities or leaving the
   "domain".  The parameter says whether the sampling comes from
   evaluating a function, so it makes sense to refine it, or is just a
   sequence of points. *)

val fn : ?n:int -> ?viewport:Gg.Box2.t ->
         ?init: float list -> ?init_pt: (float * float) list ->
         (float -> float) -> float -> float -> [`Fn] t
(** [fn f a b] returns a sampling of the graph of [f] on the interval
   \[[a], [b]\] by evaluating [f] at [n] points.
   For the optional arguments, see {!param}. *)

val param :
  ?n:int -> ?viewport:Gg.Box2.t ->
  ?init: float list -> ?init_pt: (float * (float * float)) list ->
  (float -> float * float) -> float -> float -> [`Fn] t
(** [param f a b] returns a sampling of the range of [f] on the
   interval \[[a], [b]\] by evaluating [f] at [n] points (or less).

   @param n The maximum number of evaluations of [f].  Default: [100].
          If [n] ≤ 10, then [n = 10] is used instead.
   @param init Initial values of [t] such that [f t] must be included
          into the sampling in addition to the [n] evaluations.  Only
          the values between [a] and [b] are taken into account.
          Default: empty.
   @param init_pt Initial points [(t, f t)] to include into the
          sampling in addition to the [n] evaluations.  This allows
          you to use previous evaluations of [f]. Only the couples
          with first coordinate [t] between [a] and [b] are
          considered. Default: empty. *)


(** {2 Uniform sampling} *)

val uniform : ?n:int -> (float -> float) -> float -> float -> [`Fn] t
(** [uniform f a b] returns a sampling of the graph of [f] on [n]
    equidistant points in the interval \[[a], [b]\] (the boundaries
    [a] and [b] being always included — so [n >= 2]).  The resulting
    sampling may have less than [n] points because evaluations
    returning points with NaN components are discarded (they split the
    path).

    @param n the number of points.  If [n <= 2] is given, it is
    considered as if [n=2] was passed.  Default: [n = 100]. *)


(** {2 Relation to sequences} *)

val of_path : (float * float) list -> [`Pt] t
(** Use the provided path as the sampling. *)

val to_list : _ t -> (float * float) list list
(** [to_list t] return the sampling as a list of connected components
   of the path, each of which is given as a list of (x,y) couples. *)

val of_seq : ?n: int -> (float * float) Seq.t -> [`Pt] t
(** [of_seq seq] convert the sequence of points [seq] to a sampling.

   @param n only takes at most the first [n] entries.  If [n] is not
   set (the default), this function may run into an infinite loop. *)

(** {2 Transforming samplings} *)

val tr : Gg.m3 -> _ t -> [`Pt] t
(** [tr m t] apply the transform [m] on [t].  See {!Gg.P2.tr} for more
   details. *)

val clip : _ t -> Gg.box2 -> [`Pt] t
(** [clip t b] returns the sampling [t] but clipped to the 2D box.  A
   path that crosses the boundary will get additional nodes at the
   points of crossing and the part outside the bounding box will be
   dropped.  (Thus a path entirely out of the bounding box will be
   removed.) *)

val to_channel : _ t -> out_channel -> unit

             sampling curve is drawn as several PGS paths).
             Default: [20_000].
    @param arrow The type of arrow to draw.  See the TikZ manual.
             If [arrow_pos] is specified and not this, it defaults to ">".
    @param arrow_pos the position of the arrow as a percent of the curve
             length (in the interval \[0.,1.\]).  If [arrow] is specified
             but not this, it defaults to [0.5].
