type 'a t
(** Mutable maximum priority queue, with float priority. *)

type 'a witness
(** A value witness that enables to increase its priority or remove it
   from the priority queue. *)

val make : unit -> 'a t
(** [make()] returns an empty priority queue. *)

val is_empty : 'a t -> bool
(** [is_empty q] tells whether the queue [q] is empty. *)

val add : 'a t -> float -> 'a -> unit
(** [add q p x] add [x] with priority [p] to [q].
    @raise Invalid_argument if [p] is NaN. *)

val witness_add : 'a t -> float -> 'a -> 'a witness
(** [witness_add q p x] does the same as {!add} and in addition return
   a witness for [x]. *)

val max : 'a t -> 'a
(** [max q] returns an element of [q] with maximum priority.
    @raise Failure if the queue is empty. *)

val max_priority : 'a t -> float
(** [max_priority q] returns the maximum priority of elements in [q]
    or [neg_infinity] if [q] is empty.  *)

val delete_max : 'a t -> 'a
(** [delete_max q] delete an element with maximum priority from [q]
    and return it.

    @raise Failure if the queue is empty. *)

val increase_priority : float -> 'a witness -> unit
(** [increase_priority p w] set the priority of the value pointed by
   the witness [w] to [p] (in the queue in which the value is).  If
   the new priority is lower than the previously given one, this
   function does nothing. *)

val fold : 'a t -> init:'b -> f:('b -> 'a -> 'b) -> 'b
(** [fold q init f] folds the function [f] on all elements present in
   the queue [q].  The order in which elements are passed is
   unspecified. *)

val iter : 'a t -> f:('a -> unit) -> unit
(** [iter q f] iterates the function [f] on all elements present in
    the queue [q] (which is unchanged).  The order in which elements
    are passed is unspecified. *)

val map : 'a t -> f:('a -> 'b) -> 'b t
(** [map q f] return a new priority queue with the same priority
   structure than [q] but with [f x] instead of each data value [x]. *)

val filter_map : 'a t -> f:('a -> 'b option) -> 'b t
(** [filter_map q f] Same as [map] be remove the values for which [f]
   returns [None]. *)
