Curve Sampling
==============

This module provide a collection of routines to perform adaptive
sampling of parametric and implicit curves as well as manipulating
those samplings.

Install
-------

The easier way to install this library is to use [opam][]:

    opam install curve-sampling

If you prefer to compile by hand, install the dependencies listed in
[curve-sampling.opam](curve-sampling.opam) and issue `dune build
@install`.

[opam]: https://opam.ocaml.org/


Documentation
-------------

The documentation is available in
[curve_sampling.mli](src/curve_sampling.mli) or
[online](https://chris00.github.io/ocaml-curve-sampling/doc/curve-sampling/Curve_sampling/).

Example
-------

Here is a graph of the function x ↦ x sin(1/x) produced with only 227
evaluations of the function.
